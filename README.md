**Project-3: Spam Email Classification using NLP and Machine Learning**  

- **Objective**: To build a system for detecting spam emails using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques.  
- **Significance**: With the growing volume of email communication, effective spam detection is crucial for productivity and cybersecurity.  

**Key Features**:  
- Utilizes text preprocessing to clean and transform email content into a numerical format using a Count Vectorizer.  
- Employs a machine learning model trained on email datasets for accurate classification.  
- Provides a user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit for real-time interaction.  
- Offers predictions indicating whether an email is Spam or Not Spam.  

**Technology Stack**:  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries and Frameworks**:  
  - Streamlit for building the web interface.  
  - scikit-learn for vectorization and machine learning.  
  - pandas and numpy for data handling and processing.  
- Pretrained supervised learning model for spam detection.  

**Applications**:  
- Automates spam email identification for personal and business use.  
- Enhances cybersecurity by detecting malicious or phishing emails.  
- Improves productivity by filtering irrelevant emails.  

**Repository Content**:  
- Complete project implementation, including:  
  - Trained model (spam.pkl).  
  - Vectorizer (vec.pkl).  
  - Application script (spamDetector.py).  
- Instructions for setting up and running the project.  

This system demonstrates the practical application of NLP and Machine Learning in addressing a real-world problem, making email communication more efficient and secure.
